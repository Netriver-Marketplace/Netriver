                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Netriver was founded with a simple yet powerful vision: to create a secure, trustworthy, and efficient online marketplace specifically designed for the Nigerian market. We recognized the need for a platform that connects genuine sellers with quality-conscious buyers across Nigeria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our journey began with a deep understanding of the challenges faced by both buyers and sellers in the Nigerian e-commerce landscape. We saw sellers struggling to reach customers and buyers hesitant to trust online transactions. Netriver was born to bridge this gap.
